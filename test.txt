                            At Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed 
                            Martin company, I was tasked with updating the database 
                            used in their estimating department. This involved 
                            decomposing a collection of Excel sheets into a 
                            relational model. I then built an Access based solution 
                            from this model. In order to future proof the system, I 
                            automated the system of polling an off-site database 
                            for up to date resources. To improve the system's ease 
                            of use, I added a frontend to the program. This GUI 
                            also provided functionality which could automate 
                            various tasks which are common in the estimating 
                            process.

                            At Hawkeye Technologies, I worked in 
                            the assembly and testing of infrared sources and 
                            heating elements. This involved tasks such as coil 
                            winding, spot welding, and cement casting. 
                            Occasionally I would have to machine headers and 
                            ceramics. Afterwards, I would perform bulk data 
                            collection on the newly finished batch and analyze it for any inconsistencies. <br> In my last year at Hawkeye, 
                            I was tasked with creating datasheets for the entire 
                            product catalog. As the company had recently undergone 
                            a change in management, I would also be utilizing the 
                            new branding. This including prepping the new website 
                            and updating schematics from old CAD files.

                            As part of the Institute for

                            with Steve Hazel of the Renewable Energy Alliance to 
                            develop and implement residential photo-voltaic 
                            systems. This included every step of the process, 
                            ranging from solar window analysis and site 
                            feasibility assessment up to system design and wiring.">
